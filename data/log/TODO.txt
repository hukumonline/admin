- KutuUserGroup is in HID database [www.hukumonline.com - Indonesia Server] i still do it manually for CRUD
  (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- We can change Storage Engine into InnoDB if we want to set rules. Here's how it's done:
  - Let say we've database test, with parent table User and the fields are kopel and username
    the other's table Order and the fields are id and userId. Inside table Order create Relation view.
    Link userId -> test.User.kopel
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE -> [live it blank]
    With the rules that we're just set, it means that everytime we delete parent table which is User and it
    will all delete the foreign key of user.
